# SinkhornLayer-keras

Sinkhorn layer in [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), inspired by [the reference implementation](https://github.com/google/gumbel_sinkhorn) 
of numbers sorting task solution (please see [the 'Learning Latent Permutations with Gumbel-Sinkhorn Networks' paper by Gonzalo Mena, David Belanger, Scott Linderman, Jasper Snoek](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08665)).

Requirements:
* Python3
* keras, scipy, numpy

Bug reports, comments and enhancements are welcome.
